Ingredients-  (I may write some in my native tongue so please google it. Its in hindi)
1.Potatoes (4) - boiled enough to make a knife pierce it like it was butter
2.Onions (4)- chopped
3.Edible oil (I used sarso tel)
4.Tomatoes(optional) (3-4)
5.Jeera
6.rai
7.Garlic paste
8.curry leaves(optional but great for taste) - wet them a little
9.coriander leaves
10.salt
11.turmeric (if available)

Steps:-
1. Pour 2-3 teaspoons of oil in the utensil. Wait for it to warm up.
2. Add some jeera (2-3 pinches). You should hear a frying sound.Add some rai too,same amount.
3. Add some curry leaves, according to the taste. Hot oil when interacting with water may produce pops so be careful.
4.Add onions. Add chilly powder - thumb rule - 3 teaspoons for 4 people
5.Add garlic paste  - small amount - almost equal to the amount of toothpaste that you use everyday. add turmeric
6. Mix and wait till the onions start turning red. Keep mixing so that the reddening is uniform.
7.If you wait too much the onions will get fried, so when you see them red, add tomatoes and potatoes.
8.Add water according to gravy that you need. Add some salt as per the taste. A rule of thumb - 3 pinches for 4 people.
9.Lid it. 
10. Wait for 10 minutes. It is good practice to carefully keep churning the stuff every 3-4 minutes.
11. I often take out a spoonful from the mixture and taste. (after blowing to cool ofcourse)
12. Trust me, you will know when its ready.
13. Add freshly cut coriander leaves and sprinkle on the dish to garnish.
14.Serve.
